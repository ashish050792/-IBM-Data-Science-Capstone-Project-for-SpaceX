# -IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project-for-SpaceX
## Context and Business Understanding

SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rockets at a cost of around $62m. This is considerably cheaper than other providers (which usually cost upwards of $165m), and much of the savings are because SpaceX can land, and then re-use the first stage of the rocket.

If we can make predictions on whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch, and use this information to assess whether or not an alternate company should bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

ðŸ“‘ Main Topics
This project follows these steps:

## Data Collection

Making GET requests to the SpaceX REST API

Web Scraping

## Data Wrangling

Using the .fillna() method to remove NaN values

Using the .value_counts() method to determine the following:

Number of launches on each site

Number and occurrence of each orbit

Number and occurrence of mission outcome per orbit type

Creating a landing outcome label that shows the following:

0- when the booster did not land successfully

1- when the booster did land successfully

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Using SQL queries to manipulate and evaluate the SpaceX dataset

Using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables, and determine patterns

Interactive Visual Analytics

Geospatial analytics using Folium

Creating an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash

## Predictive Analysis (Classification)

Using Scikit-Learn to:

Pre-process (standardize) the data

Split the data into training and testing data using train_test_split

Train different classification models

Find hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

Plotting confusion matrices for each classification model

Assessing the accuracy of each classification model

## ðŸ”‘ Key Skills Learned/Used

Using data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem

Using data analysis and data visualisation to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it

Interactive dashboard development with Plotly Dash

Interactive map development using Folium

Using machine learning to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently

Structuring and building a data-findings report
